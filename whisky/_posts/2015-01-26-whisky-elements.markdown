#Introduction


This is something special. Something recent, and something I hope you'll love! I recently had the pleasure of kickstarting a very interesting project called [Whisky Elements](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/263766519/whiskey-elements-customize-your-whiskey-in-24-hour). It's basically a few amazing wood sticks called 'elements' that you put in a bad cheap whisky. You leave them there for twenty four hours, the wooden sticks have been studied to maximize the amount of whisky going through the wood, filtering the whisky and giving it flavor. The next day you can drink your new transformed whisky and appreciate how much better it has become! This is somewhat of a special article so I will diverge from the usual structure. Instead I will talk about my 4 different experiments with 4 diferent 'elements'.

#The setup

I bought four different bottles identical bottles of jim bean, I've left the first one untouched, I've added the 'smoky' element to the second, 'spicy' element in the third, 'wine cask' in the fourth. 
After a day I tasted ( to compare the difference ) the first natural jim bean with the 'smoky' bottle and I was amazed! As soon as I opened the bottle I could immediately smell the difference, the 'smoky' bottle smelled peaty and lagvulinish it was incredible. That difference was confirmed after the first sip, the initial jim bean was rough, young, and clearly filled with toxic particles ready to give you a hangover. The 'smoky' bottle was on the oposite side, smooth, flavory, smoky indeed. My mind was blown! After having confirmed the power of these whisky 'elements' I added the vanilla element to the untouched bottle and waited another day before trying it.

#Spicy, Wine cask and vanilla

I moved on to the 'spicy' bottle. Again the quality of the liquor was day and night. The spicy flavor was pronounced ( but not overwhelming ), the whisky was enjoyable but lacked complexity overall. Definitely less peaty than the 'smoky' one. 

The vanilla and the wine cask flavors are actually really comparable, the vanilla is a bit lighter more floral while the wine cask reminds me more of cherries. They were both very smooth.

It was definitely enjoyable I felt like I was tasting a 10 year old scotch the original liquor was completely transformed, it's hard to believe until you actually experience it!

Don't expect an amazing scotch, it lacks complexity, it lacks peat. But overall it's very impressive.

#Color
Depends on the elements but overall it's light gold.

#Summary 

Wow. I'm definitely not regretting that kickstarter project. The transformation is something that has to be witnessed to be believed. I'm also looking forward to try multiple combinations ( if the bottle is big enough you can use multiple elements ). As I said it's not going to turn a terrible whisky into a premium scotch but I would recommend it strongly to all the scotch lovers out there it's a good time to make a fun experiment :-)
