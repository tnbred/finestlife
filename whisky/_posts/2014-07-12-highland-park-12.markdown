#Introduction


The mighty Highland Park. That's a really big one. In my experience whisky aficionados are splitting up in two sides. The Islay guys and the others. The Highland Park is usually the malt of reference for 'the others'. It's unbelievably smooth and possesses a lot of great qualities found in other great single malts. To me this is definitely a great gift idea, and also a great introductory scotch. It's very easy to drink even for somebody that doesn't usually like scotch because it doesn't have any bourbon like taste. 


#Nose

Straight from the bottle you can get a very raw spicy impression with coffee-ish side notes. You can somehow tell it's smoothness. 

The glass smell is of course more refined, you have an immediate and particularly strong cherry nose, very refreshing and enjoyable. The spices are also present along with some floral/stone fume. It's a delicious combo, fresh and that you will need to hume a few times and deeply to really grasp. The cherry and the spice gets more present after a few glasses.

It's also rich that's the second impression you get from the nose.
To me it felt like I was smelling honey cherries next to a very active fireplace, great experience and the smokiness of the smell if perfectly balanced with the rest.

#Palate 

My personal favorite moment, enjoying the first impression a scotch can pull on your tasting buds. 
The cherry was again present but mixed with the smoke I guess the overall impression is dried cherry a bit fruity. It also had a nice honey taste mixed up in there.
This very light side was balanced by the spices and smoke which intertwined together transports you in an other world. This sugar meets salt taste is absolutely exquisite and to me it was the highlight of this scotch.
I could picture myself in a Kirkwall inn mingling with the Scottish people and dealing with their roughs exteriors but warm hearts. This duality is perfectly represented in an highland park glass. It's the perfect northerner's malt.

#Finish

This scotch is very well married it's just impressive. The finish is again a mix of salt and sugar. Light caramel I would say and sea salt with a touch of smokiness. It's a pretty mesmerizing combination and it will make you want more.
It's a long mellow finish.


#Color
amber with hints of red.

#Summary 

Amazing experience. It's a big hard to really differentiate so many intertwined flavors but it's a highly addictive combination. With a few extra tastes I could also get some chocolate, citrus and a bit of orange. Definitely a well rounded and complex malt. I'm still more of an Islay person but I have to give it to the highland park for making me experience a very nice duality in the Scottish character. 

I would without a doubt buy it again.
