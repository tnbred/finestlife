#Introduction

Nikka from the barrel is pretty famous, it's one of the most well known Japanese scotch whiskies.
It's mostly known because for its value for money, since it's very cheap for a high quality product.
The bottle is simple but conveys strength, this is my favorite scotch in the Nikka family.

#Nose
Very interesting nose, you can immediately tell how sweet this liquor is. The sweetness is actually
almost overpowering other important notes like the floral one. 
You may also get hints of oak.
Vanilla is the main component here, that's where the sweetness comes from and interestingly this is 
what gives the scotch such a unique character.

#Palate 
Let's move on to the good stuff ! 
The taste reveals a mildly complex scotch, it opens with (no suprises) a vanilla dominated impression but then
moves on to gradually add some spices into the mix which I find extremely pleasant!
I'm saying mildly complex because the taste does evolve from vanilla to vanilla and spices but it's 
pretty straightforward compared to many Islays.
I really like how the spices come pretty much out of nowhere but slowly enough so that you can really feel it and enjoy it to the fullest!

#Finish
The Nikka has a very long finish, the spice is dominant here even more than vanilla. It's probably the longest
finish I've had in a scotch I couldn't believe how much the taste would just stick with me. I'm a fan.


#Color
Light gold, maroon, hints of red

#Summary 

Clearly it was a great experience! That scotch is delicious, it changes from the rest of my peat heavy collection, 
it does its job beautifully.
It's clearly a very good addition for you scotch lovers out there. One of the most original scotch I drank
in a while. I think it doesn't reach the quality of other monuments (Lagavulin, Uigeadail, Triple Wood, ...)
but bear in mind that it's also a third of the price.

Buy Again? Of course.
