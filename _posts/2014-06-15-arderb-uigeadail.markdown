#Introduction

Ardeg uigeadail ( oog-a-dal ) is an establishment , a monument of whiskies. The uigeadail is little known to outsiders from the whisky community however for the amateur the uigdeadail is an institution. The oog is a slam dunk for most whisky lovers out there, it's complex, has little bite and very savory. Personally it's my number one scotch. I remember vividly the first glass I had and how it opened my eyes to the richness of Islays. It took some time for me to be able to grasp all the power from the oog, but now I couldn't imagine not having a bottle at home. It is my pleasure today to try to share my enthusiasm for this nectar, let me take you on this amazing tasting journey.

#Nose
This is where it all starts. I like to have two kinds of nose impression, the bottle and the glass.
I started by carefully removing the cork seal, I then proceeded to delicately remove the cork. In an instant you can smell the amazing vapor coming from the scotch, and it is complex. It took a few deep breath to really understand what I had here. The smell from the bottle ( which is a little stronger than the glass smell obviously ) reminded me of smoked meat. When it first enter your nose and then it subtly distills itself to some vanilla-ish odor.
You could definitely smell the peat.
After an interesting first impression I poured a glass.
The glass nose had even more to say. It revealed the richness of the whisky, it felt very rich and oily straight away.
You also had a nutty feeling, almost almond like.

#Palate 
I'm done teasing myself, now I moved on to tasting it. 
It first comes accross as peated, if you're careful you could also sense some apple. Then it starts having some vanilla hints. The next transition is extremely smooth, it turns from peated vanilla to ash and smoked meat but not in an intrusive way it's a fantastic fleeing middle taste. It's definitely very rich and oily which exacerbates the taste.

#Finish
As I said it's a complex whisky, the finish is very different from the palate.
The switch is gradual from the taste, you can slowly feel the almond making an entrance, quickly joined by a strong taste of peat. The peat fades away slowly to leave an amazing combination of dark chocolate and honey.


#Color
Golden but not opaque


#Summary 

What's striking about the oog is the smoothness of the transitions, I think that really binds together all the different savors of this elixir.
It's really my kind of drink, it has many amazing flavors and is peated, it's the kind of scotch you could rediscover every time you taste it. It's always a different spirit.
