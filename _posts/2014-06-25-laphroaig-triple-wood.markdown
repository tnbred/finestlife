#Introduction

The laphroaig triple wood is a very interesting scotch. It's not very well known and I think it definitely deserve some light. It's also quite unique amongst other Laphroaigs, it isn't as bitter.  To give it justice though I think the best introduction I can make is to quote the text received with the bottle : 
"Uncork a bottle and the aroma of soft,spicy peat smoke will take you on a journey straight to the heart of the island's community.
Laphroaig is a Gaelic word meaning 'beautiful hollow by the broad bay', marries malted barley with smoke from our native, hand-cut peat nto produce one of the most richly flavoured of all Scotch' whiskies"
Let's just say that sets the bar pretty damn high. I say we move on to the nose part.

#Nose

After removing the cork, the strong smell quickly fills up the room. The first thing that comes to mind is that it's heavily peated, with that follows a very nice and smooth ash/smoked wood impression. Really it whets the appetite.
I'm pouring myself a glass right and now I'm going for the real thing. The glass smell is as expected more complex than the bottle nose. A refreshing dominant orange odor along with some spicy notes. The spice takes over on the peat. You can also be reminded of iodine at this point. At this point I think the official description is pretty spot on. I'm expecting a highly flavored peated whisky ( my favorite kind ).

#Palate 

That's where I think the triple wood really distinguish itself from other Laphroaigs, the palate is unbieliably smooth, there's no bitterness, no bite, really incredible I don't recall having tasted such a soft whisky in a while. The first flavour builds up slowly to a strong vanilla taste with a hint of apricot. When the vanilla reaches its peak it turns into an amazing salted butter/caramel after taste, to me this part was my favorite of the triple wood experience. This phase can last really long pretty much as much as you keep the liquid in your mouth and is highly enjoyable.

#Finish

The triple wood would not deserve his name if  the fact that the scotch has been in three different barrels wasn't noticeable. It starts by having an overwhelmingly peated sensation which fades away to smoked wood, reminding me of those winters next to the chimney staring at the fire while it snows outside. In the end it's a great finish.
I was a bit disapointed just because I was expecting a little more flavours.

#Summary 

The triple wood is a great choice, it's one of those unmissable Islays if you ask me. It has all the components of a great scotch. I enjoyed all the flavors, the nice peated touch and a great smoked finish. It's straightforward and honest about what you can expect from it, my favorite Laphroaig.
I will grade less than the uigeadail simply because for every step it's less complex.
