#Introduction

This is a Nicaraguan cigar. Definitely my go to non cuban cigar. AJ Fernandez did an amazing job with the San Lotano, especially the maduro variety which is by far my preferred choice. Interesting story is that AJ Fernandez was raised in Cuba and he still watches himself the Nicaraguan factory on a daily basis. I've smoked a dozen of these cigars ( at least ) and the quality is there no question about that. It's also interesting to see the Cuban traditions exported elsewhere. I heavily recommend this marvelous cigar for all the new comers. Even the maduro which is fairly strong has a very distinct and unique flavor.

#Tasting
That's it I'm starting my degustation! Breathing in the splendid cigar... It's obvious that its perfumes are completely different from the ones of a cuban cigar. You have this very distinct very sweet nose overpowering everything else. The first few puffs immediately reveals the essence of this cigar : the fig ! Yes you read that well, sure you can feel the amazing spice or the woodiness but instead you should look for the fig. That's the secret component that makes this cigar so unique and so appreciable. No doubt that this is the sweatest maduro I've ever experienced. There's something to be said about the subtlety of this stick. It's not every day that you have such a distinct and perceptible fig flavor in a cigar. You can tell right at the beginning and it gets stronger as you reach the middle. 

#Conclusion

This cigar is so balanced it's just fantastic. Think about it : a full bodied maduro cigar with a sweet dominant taste. If you want adventure, discovery or just learn something new about the fascinating world of cigars. I would highly recommend exploring in the AJ Fernandez family and especially this San Lotano. The unparalleled quality of the blend and the smooth smoke makes it a great first cigar. If you feel like you'll smoke a couple in a row it won't burn your pallet.
