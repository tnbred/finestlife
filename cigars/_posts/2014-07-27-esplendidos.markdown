#Introduction

The Esplendidos is one of the best cohiba sticks out there. It's extremly easy to smoke and very complex. On top of that churchill is my favorite format for cigars. Taking your time when chosing a cigar is of utmost importance. There is a tremendous difference between two similar cigars if one has visible veins, moisture marks or even tobacco aggregations. That's going to break the burn. That will make the experience not as comfortable as it could have been. Therefore I took my time and picked the best Esplendidos in the box. It was just at the right level of moisture ( I was smoking it a couple hours after the purchase ) and almost no physical defaults.
In this case I prefered to punch the cigar rather than a straight cut because Cohibas have a very good draw so that would be more than enough to enjoy the stick.
The color of the Colorado wrapper is a beautiful reddish, dark brown.

#Tasting
Just by smelling the cigar you're already on another land. Huming those majestic leaves you realize that it's a very aromatic cigar.
I lit it up and took my initial puff, I was instantly hooked. Those sweet cedar aromas that fills your palate and transports you elsewhere in a place where time stops. A few more puffs and you start to refine your judgement, to the initial cedar you can add some nice dark choclate and cocoa. The more you progress and the more you will start to get an espresso after taste.
Of course all this is wrapped into the classic Cohiba earthy mustiness. There's also a nice faint spicy impression coming and going at each puff.

#Conclusion

This is a complex cigar, I've given my general impressions but remember it's a handrolled cuban cigar therefore the best part is that you can never really predict what you get. That also means that the smoke will probably not be very even I had to correct it manually a couple times. This isn't a Davidoff don't be afraid to lit it multiple times.
To me it's one of the best cigars out there, a perfect after dinner delicacy.
