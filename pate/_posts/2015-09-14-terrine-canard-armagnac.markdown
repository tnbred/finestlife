#Introduction

Back in the Périgord Noir with the Maison Vaux. Today, I'm excited to try the Duck terrine with Armagnac.

#Composition

It is composed of pork fat and lean, lean duck liver (30%), duck meat (10%), Armagnac (2,5%), eggs and seasoning (including cilantro).

#Degustation

The can design is quite trendy for a pâté, which I appreciate.
The nose is delicate with subtle fragrances of Armagnac.
The burgundy color due to the duck meat is really nice with the shards of fat.

The palate is powerful just as it has to be. I loved the balance between spices and the Armagnac. Moreover the fine taste of Armagnac add a fruity hint very interesting. 

#Conclusion

I really enjoyed this local terrine from the Périgord and I definitely recommend it. It's a great way
to discover those subtle armagnac terrine. If you liked it I would recommend checking out other Maison Vaux products.
