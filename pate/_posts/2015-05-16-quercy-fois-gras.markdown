#Introduction

The Authentique Pâté du Quercy is elaborated by Michel Monteil, Maître Artisan (craftsman master)
and produced by Le Hameau des Saveurs in the South West of France.

#Composition

This Pâté is mainly made of french pork and foie gras splinters (20%). It has a great aspect and an excellent holding on bread.
The texture is soft and pleasurable. 

#Degustation

The taste is fine and soft. Surprisingly I found this Pâté not too fat. 
The raw materials are undeniably genuine.
 The only snag, in my opinion is a lack of spices. 
 Maybe a leaf of bay laurel and a pinch of green pepper should have increase the character of this Pâté.

#Conclusion

Overall a very interesting experience and a product that reflects well its terroir.
