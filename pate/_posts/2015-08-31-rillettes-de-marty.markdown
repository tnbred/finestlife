#Introduction

The Marty 's farm is settled in the heart of the Xaintrie Noire (Corrèze, France). 
The farm (that can be visited during summer) produce and commercialize those rillettes (among others slating and pâtés). 

#Composition

Those old fashioned rillettes are composed of lean and fat pork, salt and pepper. 

#Degustation


When you put it in your mouth, the taste is quite soft. It strengthens with the chewing.
At least the pepper add a tip of spices. In my opinion, the pepper balance is one of the best asset of the rillettes. 

#Conclusion

I'll qualify those rillettes as rustics. Despite of the packaging, that I really don't like (and it will count towards the grade).
They are simple and they pay tribute to the quality of the pork used.
