#Introduction

There are many different brie. The best of them can be found in the Brie region in France, this product
is also from this region. This brie is probably one of the most famous ones, it's a high quality product 
with a lot of history. It is said that Charlemagne use to order two cartloads every week!
This cheese is made with unpasterized milk, the workers actually assemble the fermented milk by hand
to give it its unique shape and taste.

#Tasting

As always, I took the cheese out of the fridge a couple hours before the tasting, patiently waiting 
for it to reach the right consistence. Soon the amazing smell started to fill up the air and I had to
discipline myself to avoid being to hasty. The crust of this brie is very delicate, more than I'm used to.

The taste is absolutely fantastic, most great bries have this quality that as soon as you're done 
eating a piece of it you get that rustic after taste that makes you want to taste more of it!
It really builds up on your palate, starting very smoothly and slowly increasing to the climax.

Because the brie is formed by hand you have some imperfections and areas that are more dense than others 
giving the taster a unique experience at each degustation. 

Though the Brie de Meaux wasn't as strong as other bries from the same region and I tend to prefer bries
with more character, it was nonetheless extremely enjoyable. Overall I would strongly recommend this brie as
a 'go-to' brie, it's high quality and deliciously creamy. For more sophisticated brie lovers I would highly 
recommend exploring other products from the region as it is filled with many many cheese wonders.
