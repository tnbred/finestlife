#Introduction

While I was doing my groceries, I found a unexpected cheese. A Microfiltered Camembert matured with Calvados in a pretty box. I definitively had to try it. 

#Composition

The Camembert is mainly made with microfiltered caws milk, Calvados (10%), bread crumbles (3%).
It is produced by the Isigny Sainte-MÃ¨re's cooperative in Normandy. 

#Degustation

The cheese aspect is really fine but when you open it, the bread crumbles are sprayed all over the plate or the table. 
Nonetheless, the smell is great. A good balance between Camembert and Calvados. I think this is the best asset of this cheese. 
Indeed, the taste let me on my end. This Camembert have definitively a potential but the taste is too soft. In my opinion, this cheese must be stronger, more frank.

#Conclusion

Probably raw milk should have been a better material than microfiltered, but an issue for export.
