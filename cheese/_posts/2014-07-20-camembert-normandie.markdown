#Introduction

Let me preface this review by saying that I'm kind of a camembert extremist. Your cheese isn't camembert if it isn't from Normandy. It isn't camembert if it has pasteurized milk (sorry USA). 
I happen to have a good friend that lives in Normandy and knows some local farmers there and that's how I got my hands on this little jewel. 

Camembert is probably the first cheese you get introduced to ( at least for Europeans ). It's definitely an amazing cheese and even if it's the 'basic' unit of cheese it has a lot of character. Also let's be honest, what kind of person would do a wine and cheese without a good camembert ?

I love when my cow milk, hard paste cheeses are melty. That's why I usually get the camembert out of the fridge a solid 2/3 hours before tasting them.

I also buy some freshly baked bread, usually with a lot of loaf. And finally a nice and tannic wine (red burgundy but I'm biased by my origins).

#Tasting

There's a great deal of things to say here, a camembert is at the same time simple and complex. If you look at the bigger picture
it's fairly straight forward, the creamy paste has a very tought farmer's dairy taste and the crust finished the palate with an extremely addicting taste of pasture.

If you try to go in the details it becomes very complex, this delicious slice of cheese you've flatten on your piece of bread holds a wide and diverse range of dairy flavors. 

After a bite you will feel like you are sitting next to the cow, in the fresh grass with a light breeze giving you some fresh air. The ineffable taste of the crust will be deep in your palate. From there you have two options, the taste is so good that you have to either take another delicious bite or wash the whole thing down with a sip of your favorite red wine.

It's a great tasting experience, any food lover should try it at least once.

#Summary

The camembert has the roughness of the Normandy farmers that made it and it has a soft dairy core coming from the peaceful cow that provided the milk. Whole in whole it's a must eat cheese. A good one is hard to find but the difference is very noticeable, pasteurized milk adds a sanitizer/plastic taste which greatly changes the roughness of the cheese. There are also so many ways to eat it, you can melt it on pretty much anything and you'll have yourself a fantastic guilty pleasure.
