#Introduction

I know this will be a bit out from the ordinary, it's not a whisky!

It could also seem a bit old fashion, but that's a nonsense. Eau-de-vie deserves to be in the spotlight for once.

Picture the perfect moment, after a good diner with friends. Everyone is seated in a comfortable armchair. Here is the right timing for a (rightfully named) after diner liquor.

#Origins


The plum eau-de-vie that I'll review is kind of unique.
It is not for sale.
An acquaintance made it traditionally in Loubressac (Lot-France) in 2009.
In this part of France, farmers use to make their own eau-de-vie. In addition to this folklore, I invite you to picture the alambic settled in one of the most beautiful town I know. Perched on a hilltop.

Try to think about the smell of plums and freshly cut grass while you admire the 180° view between the castle of Saint-Céré and the castle of Castelnau Bretenoux...

#Nose

The smell of Loubressac's plum eau-de-vie is sharp but enjoyable. Not too intrusive.
If you pay attention, you will recognize some wood-fire and plum smell.

#Palate 

The palate is as sharp as the nose.

Swallow it and you will feel the burn everywhere in your body where the liquid runs down.
Throughout the process the plum is very present.
Beware, most eau-de-vie are very raw, you'll definitely feel the bite. Though don’t worry you'll appreciate it !

#Finish

For the finish, you'll have a cool sensation after the first glass.
It's a great contrast with the initial burn.

If you drink more than a glass, you'll feel like your tasting buds are a bit dull ! It is only an illusion, the taste of plum is quite tenacious !

#Color
Transparent.


#Summary 

The plum eau-de-vie is a "manly" beverage, even though I use to know a Polish girl that drank that for breakfast.

Eau-de-vie is nowadays clearly not "mainstream".

Despite its raw and powerful taste it is something you should try at least once.
Pear, plum, mirabelle ... You have the choice.

It is made to be offered and shared.
